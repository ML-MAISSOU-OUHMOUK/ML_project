Drug discovery in the fields of medicine and biotechnology, is the process in which new medications are discovered. However, drug development remains extremely expensive and time consuming. The new approaches concentrate on looking into preexisting Drugs and the possibility of using them in many new different treatments.
The prediction of drug-target interactions (DTI) is vital for drug discovery.
The goal of this project is to implement some Machine Learning methods to build a model that helps with the predictions of possible new interaction between drugs and proteins related to a certain disease in order to exploit these medications Using social network analysis.
